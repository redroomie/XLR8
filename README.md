# About XLR8
XLR8 fastest way to connect and stay anonymous without any proxy & socks5 in tor 
XLR8 is a tool that make all your internet traffic anonymized through Tor network.

# Before you use XLR8 ( Tor Browser is recommended )
* For the goodness of Tor network, BitTorrent traffic will be blocked by iptables. Although you can bypass it with some tweaks with your torrent client ðŸ˜¥. It's difficult to completely block all torrent traffic.
* For security reason, TorghostNG is gonna disable IPv6 to prevent IPv6 leaks (it happened to me lmao).
